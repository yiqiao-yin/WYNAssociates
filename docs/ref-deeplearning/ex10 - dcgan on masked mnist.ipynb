Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A *generator* (\"the artist\") learns to create images that look real, while a *discriminator* (\"the art critic\") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.\n","\n","<p align='center'><img src='https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/images/gan1.png?raw=1'></img></p>\n","\n","During training, the *generator* progressively becomes better at creating images that look real, while the *discriminator* becomes better at telling them apart. The process reaches equilibrium when the *discriminator* can no longer distinguish real images from fakes.\n","\n","<p align='center'><img src='https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/images/gan2.png?raw=1'></img></p>\n","\n","This notebook demonstrates this process on the MNIST dataset.
