       "   'content': \"The 2024 Masters Tournament was the 88th edition of the Masters Tournament and the first of the men's four major golf championships held in 2024. The tournament was played from April 11–14 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, United States. Scottie Scheffler won his second Masters and major, four strokes ahead of runner-up Ludvig Åberg, who was playing in his first major. Scheffler became the fourth-youngest two-time winner of the tournament and the second player, after Tiger Woods in 2001, to win both the Masters and The Players Championship in the same calendar year. \\n\\n\\n== Course ==\\n\\nThe only change to the course for the 2024 tournament was the lengthening of the second hole by ten yards.\\n\\n\\n== Field ==\\nParticipation in the Masters Tournament is by invitation only, and the tournament has the smallest field of the major championships.

The first was to add the current NCAA Division I Men's Individual Champion a spot in the field, provided that he remains an amateur at the time of the tournament. In addition, Augusta National clarified that players who qualify for the Tour Championship must remain eligible to play in that event in order to qualify for the Masters. Also, with the PGA Tour returning to a calendar-year season schedule, Augusta National noted that winners of fall PGA Tour events would continue to qualify for the Masters.\\nThe below list details the qualification criteria for the 2024 Masters Tournament and the players who have qualified under them; any additional criteria under which players qualified are indicated in parentheses.\\n1.

As a result, 27 players did not complete the first round on Thursday.\\nThe 8th hole, a par 5, saw a record-breaking total of 53 par-breaking scores, including 50 birdies and 3 eagles, the highest ever recorded on this hole in Masters history. \\n\\n\\n=== Second round ===\\nFriday, April 12, 2024\\nBy making the cut, Tiger Woods set the record for most consecutive cuts made at the Masters, at 24. Phil Mickelson made the cut for the 28th time, surpassing Raymond Floyd and Bernhard Langer to move into solo fourth place for most cuts made at the Masters, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (37), Fred Couples (31) and Gary Player (30).\\nRookie Ludvig Åberg posted the lowest score of the round, a 69, and advanced to a solo 7th place.\\nBryson DeChambeau, before making a birdie on the 13th hole, moved a large directional sign that was in his line of play.\\nPatrick Cantlay achieved two eagles on par 4s, marking only the fourth instance in history that a player has recorded two par-4 eagles in a single Masters Tournament, the last being Brandt Jobe in 2006.\\nThe cut came at 150 (+6), with 60 players advancing to the weekend. Notables to miss the cut included 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, 2020 champion Dustin Johnson, reigning U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark, Open champion Brian Harman, and World No. 6 Viktor Hovland. Two-time major champion Justin Thomas played his last four holes in seven-over to miss the cut by one shot.\\n\\n\\n=== Third round ===\\nSaturday, April 13, 2024\\nScottie Scheffler, beginning the round in a three-way tie for the lead, chipped in for birdie on the first hole. After a double bogey on the 10th, Scheffler holed a 31-foot eagle putt on the par-five 13th, the only eagle recorded on that hole during the round. He also birdied the 15th and 18th to finish at seven under following a 71 (−1) to take a one-shot lead into the final round.\\nCollin Morikawa birdied his first three holes in a three-under round of 69 and finished at six under, one shot back of Scheffler. Max Homa, tied for the lead at the start of the round, didn't make a birdie in a one-over 73 and fell two back at 5 under. Bryson DeChambeau was also atop the leaderboard to begin the round but hit his third shot in the water on the 15th and made double bogey. He holed out for birdie on the 18th to finish at three under and four shots back of Scheffler. Ludvig Åberg, making his Masters and major championship debut, was four under on his round until a bogey at the 14th. He then left his third shot on the 15th short and three-putted from just off the green for another bogey. He shot 70 (–2) and ended up at four under.\\nNicolai Højgaard moved into sole possession of the lead following a run of three straight birdies from holes 8 to 10, but he then made five straight bogeys including hitting into the water on both the 13th and 15th and finished at two under.\\nTiger Woods carded a 10-over-par 82 for the third round, his highest score ever in a major championship.\\nNo eagles were recorded on the par-5 15th hole through the first three rounds, marking only the second time in the past 50 years that No. 15 has failed to produce an eagle by this point in the tournament. Shane Lowry scored an eagle on the par-4 14th hole, marking the first eagle on this hole since Martin Kaymer in 2016.\\n\\n\\n=== Final round ===\\nSunday, April 14, 2024\\n\\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler shot a four-under 68 to win his second Masters title in the last three years by four shots over runner-up Ludvig Åberg.\\nScheffler began the round with a one-shot lead and birdied the third hole to go two shots ahead. He then bogeyed the fourth after hitting his tee shot over the green. Max Homa birdied the second, his first birdie in 34 holes, to get within one of the lead, while Åberg hit his approach on the seventh to four feet and made birdie to also get within one of the lead.\\nScheffler bogeyed the seventh to create a three-way tie with Åberg and Collin Morikawa at six under, while Homa joined the lead with a two-putt birdie at the par-five eighth. Both Scheffler and Morikawa birdied the eighth to get to seven under, while Åberg holed a 36-foot birdie putt on the ninth to again tie. Scheffler then hit his approach on the ninth to within a foot for another birdie to get to 8 under and again in sole possession of the lead going to the second nine.\\nAll three challengers then fell from contention. Morikawa hit his second shot on the ninth into a greenside bunker and couldn't advance on his third, ending up with a double bogey to fall three shots behind. He found the water on his approach at the 11th and made another double bogey. Åberg also hit into the water on the 11th for a double bogey. Homa got back within one with a close approach to the 10th, but his tee shot on the 12th flew over the green into the bushes and he was forced to take a drop. He made a double bogey on the hole to fall three shots behind.\\nScheffler birdied the 10th, his third birdie in a row, to get to nine under and open a two-shot lead. Despite a bogey on the 11th, Scheffler two-putted for birdie at the par-five 13th and hit his second shot on the 14th to within four feet for another birdie to reach 10 under. He then made a nine-foot birdie putt on the par-three 16th to get to 11 under. Pars on his final two holes allowed him to close out the tournament with a four-shot victory.\\nÅberg birdied the 13th and 14th to get back to seven under and finish four back of Scheffler in his Masters and major championship debut. Morikawa and Homa both finished at four under for the tournament, in a tie for third place along with Tommy Fleetwood.\\n\\n\\n==== Scorecard ====\\n\\nCumulative tournament scores, relative to par\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\"}]}"

It was Sainz's first win of the 2024 season after undergoing an appendectomy prior to the previous race in Saudi Arabia. Lando Norris secured his 14th career podium with a 3rd place finish, surpassing Nick Heidfeld's record for most podiums without a win. The race saw a high attrition rate, with Max Verstappen retiring early due to brake failure after starting on pole, ending his streak of 9 consecutive wins. The event set a new attendance record at Albert Park.\n"

      "Claude wants to use tool: get_article\n",
      "Claude's response:\n",
      "Based on the Wikipedia article, I can provide you with a comprehensive explanation of quantum computing:\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is Quantum Computing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computing is a revolutionary computational paradigm that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. Instead of using traditional bits that can only be in states of 0 or 1, quantum computers use **qubits** (quantum bits) that can exist in a **superposition** of both states simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Qubits and Superposition**\n",
      "- While classical bits are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a combination of both states at once\n",
      "- This is represented mathematically as α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are probability amplitudes\n",
      "- This allows quantum computers to process multiple possibilities simultaneously\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Quantum Entanglement**\n",
      "- Qubits can be \"entangled,\" meaning they become correlated in ways that measuring one instantly affects the others\n",
      "- This creates powerful computational connections between qubits that don't exist in classical systems\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Quantum Interference**\n",
      "- Quantum algorithms use interference effects to amplify correct answers and cancel out wrong ones\n",
      "- This is key to achieving quantum speedups over classical algorithms\n",
      "\n",
      "## How It Works\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers operate by:\n",
      "1. Preparing qubits in superposition states\n",
      "2. Applying quantum logic gates (like classical logic gates but for quantum states)\n",
      "3. Using quantum algorithms that leverage superposition and entanglement\n",
      "4. Measuring the final quantum state to get classical output\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current State and Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Advantages:**\n",
      "- Potential exponential speedup for certain problems (like factoring large numbers with Shor's algorithm)\n",
      "- Excellent for simulating quantum systems in chemistry and physics\n",
      "- Promising for optimization problems and machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Current Limitations:**\n",
      "- **Quantum decoherence**: Qubits are extremely fragile and lose their quantum properties quickly\n",
      "- **Error rates**: Current quantum computers have high error rates (around 5% for large machines)\n",
      "- **Scale**: Largest current systems have around 2,000 qubits, but need millions for practical applications\n",
      "- **Specialized applications**: Not yet better than classical computers for most real-world problems\n",
      "\n",
      "## Potential Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cryptography**: Could break current encryption methods but also enable ultra-secure quantum communication\n",
      "2. **Drug discovery**: Modeling molecular interactions for pharmaceutical development\n",
      "3. **Financial modeling**: Portfolio optimization and risk analysis\n",
      "4. **Artificial intelligence**: Potential speedups for certain machine learning algorithms\n",
      "5. **Climate modeling**: Simulating complex environmental systems\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Reality Check\n",
      "\n",
      "As of 2023, quantum computers are still primarily experimental. While they've achieved \"quantum supremacy\" on specific benchmark problems, they haven't yet demonstrated practical advantages for real-world applications. Current quantum computers are described as being \"for now, absolutely nothing\" in terms of practical utility, though this is expected to change as the technology matures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The field is rapidly evolving, with major tech companies like Google, IBM, and others investing heavily in development, but practical, fault-tolerant quantum computers that outperform classical computers on useful tasks remain years away.\n"
