# SQL ORDER BY Keyword

The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

The `ORDER BY` keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the `DESC` keyword.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```
