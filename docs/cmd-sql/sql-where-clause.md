# SQL WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The following operators can be used in the `WHERE` clause:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `=` | Equal |
| `>` |	Greater than |
| `<` |	Less than	|
| `>=` |	Greater than or equal	|
| `<=` |	Less than or equal	|
| `<>` |	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	 |
| `BETWEEN` |	Between a certain range	|
| `LIKE` | 	Search for a pattern	|
| `IN` |	To specify multiple possible values for a column |
